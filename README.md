# leaflet-bug

This is a repo with a reproduce for a Leaflet bug; where in some WebView-browsers you can't apply a custom CSS-filter (in 1.9.2).

Most of the interesting stuff can be found [here](https://github.com/andreandersson/leaflet-bug/blob/main/app/src/main/assets/index.html)

## Video

See the following video demonstrating the bug:

As soon as a `CSS-filter` is added to `img`, this behaviour can be seen on some Android Phones (among them; Pixel 7 Pro).
